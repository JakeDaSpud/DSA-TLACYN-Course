# What is this?

This is my work for [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/), a ***FREE*** 10 hour course on _practical_ Data Structures & Algorithms, led by the Programmer / YouTuber ThePrimeagen.

It goes over *Time Complexity* (Big O), *Whiteboard-Programming* (like in interviews) and *Implementation* of useful Algorithms and Data Structures.

Since I'm already interested in the topic, why not get a head start? It'll prove useful for my general C / C++ / Gamedev / Programming mindsets anyways!
